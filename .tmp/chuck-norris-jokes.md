> When Chuck Norris watches Dora the Explora, Dora doesn't ask any questions.

That is one of many Chuck Norris Jokes you can find in this Android App. I created this app to learn how to build a hybrid mobile app.

## Quasar Framework

[Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev/) is a framework based on Vue.js that helps you build websites, mobile and desktop applications using the same code base. For this project I just created a mobile application but I could also build a web and desktop version.

## The Internet Chuck Norris Database

There is a free API totally dedicated to Chuck Norris jokes([The Internet Chuck Norris Database](http://www.icndb.com/api/)) and that's where I a saw an opportunity to use it and apply it to this mobile app.
