The things I enjoy working most with are Javascript (Vue.js and Node.js), Linux/Unix-based OSes and hybrid mobile development (<a href="https://quasar.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">QuasarFramework</a>). I also have front-end and back-end with languages and tools, including: TypeScript, Java, Python, RESTful APIs, Databases, and Agile Development.</p><h2 id="spoken-languages" tabindex="-1">Spoken Languages <a class="header-anchor" href="#spoken-languages" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>My first language is Brazilian Portuguese and I have been studying English for a long time.

I used to play the drums, but it&#39;s an instrument that is hard to keep and maintain. It requires space and everybody knows how noisy it is. Lately, I&#39;ve been giving more attention to the Guitars. I&#39;m practicing some easy songs through Youtube and having a lot of fun with my daughter.</p>',6),o=[i];function r(l,d,h,u,p,c){return a(),n("div",null,o)}const f=e(s,[["render",r]]);export{b as __pageData,f as default};
