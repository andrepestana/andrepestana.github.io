I used to play the drums but it&#39;s an instrument that is hard to keep and maintain. It requires space and everybody knows how noisy it is. Lately I&#39;ve been giving more attention to the Guitars. I&#39;m practicing some easy songs through Youtube and having so much fun with my daughter.</p>',6),o=[i];function r(d,l,h,u,p,c){return a(),n("div",null,o)}const f=e(t,[["render",r]]);export{b as __pageData,f as default};
