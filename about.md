## Me, myself and I

My name is Andre Pestana and I'm a Brazilian that immigrated to Canada. I'm in my forties and I've passed through some challenges as a husband, father, immigrant and professional. Now I'm trying to find some balance in life, to reconnect to my true friends and make new ones, to have healthier meals and practice exercises and also practicing some hobbies I've left for other priorities.

## Professional

I'm a software developer based in Canada with more than 15 years of experience working as a full-stack developer for the latest five years. I also have front-end and back-end with languages and tools, including: TypeScript, Java, Python, RESTful APIs, Databases, and Agile Development.

## Spoken Languages

My first language is Brazilian Portuguese and I have been studying English for a long time. Lately, I've been improving my Spanish (which I can understand well because of the similarities with Portuguese) and practicing French on Duolingo.

## Hobbies

I wish I had more time for hobbies. I used to play the drums, but it's an instrument that is hard to keep and maintain. It requires space and everybody knows how noisy it is. Lately, I've been giving more attention to the guitars.
