## Me, myself and I

My name is André Pestana, and I’m a Brazilian who made the life-changing decision to immigrate to Canada. Now in my forties, I’ve faced many challenges — not only as a husband and father but also as an immigrant and a professional navigating new landscapes. Each of these roles has shaped who I am today.

At this stage of my life, I’m focused on finding a better balance — among work, family, personal growth, and health. I’m making a conscious effort to reconnect with my true friends, nurture meaningful relationships, and open space in my life to meet new people. I’m also paying closer attention to my well-being by eating healthier, exercising regularly, and gradually rediscovering hobbies that I once set aside for other priorities.

It’s a journey of reconnection, self-care, and building a life that feels more authentic to who I truly am — both personally and professionally.

## Professional

My career in technology has been a journey of continuous learning and adaptation. I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems and a Postgraduate Certificate in Software Engineering. These academic foundations have equipped me with the skills to navigate the ever-evolving tech landscape.

Professionally, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects that have challenged and honed my abilities. My experiences span various aspects of software development, and I've always been driven by a passion for creating efficient and innovative solutions.

A significant milestone in my career was relocating to Canada. This move was motivated by a desire to immerse myself in a dynamic tech environment and to contribute to projects with a global impact. Canada’s inclusive and forward-thinking tech community has provided me with the platform to grow both personally and professionally.

Currently, I am a Senior Application Developer at AOT Technologies, based in Victoria, British Columbia. In this role, I collaborate with a talented team to develop applications that streamline processes and enhance user experiences. Being part of AOT Technologies has allowed me to work on cutting-edge projects that align with my passion for technology and innovation.

## Spoken Languages

My first language is Brazilian Portuguese, and learning English as my second language has been one of the most challenging — yet rewarding — experiences of my life. It took years of dedication, setbacks, and persistence to feel comfortable communicating in a new language. Even today, I continue to refine my skills, and every small improvement reminds me how far I’ve come.

This long journey with English sparked in me a genuine excitement for learning other languages. Over time, language learning became more than just a necessity; it became a passion. Lately, I’ve been practicing French, mainly through Duolingo, where I proudly maintain a streak of over 1,500 days. I've also been working on improving my Spanish, which I can understand fairly well thanks to its many similarities with Portuguese.

For me, studying new languages isn't just about vocabulary and grammar — it's about connecting with people, cultures, and different ways of thinking. Each language opens a new window into the world, and I find that incredibly motivating.

## Hobbies

I often wish I had more time to dedicate to my hobbies. In the past, I was passionate about graphic arts — drawing and painting were creative outlets that brought me a lot of joy. I spent many hours practicing techniques like composition, perspective, and the use of color and tone, all of which helped shape the way I see the world today.

More recently, my creative energy has shifted toward photography. Having a background in traditional arts has been a huge advantage, as the principles I learned continue to guide how I frame, balance, and capture images. Photography has become a new way for me to express myself — one that blends technical skill with artistic vision.

Music has also played an important role in my life. I used to play the drums, an instrument I truly loved, but it's not the easiest hobby to maintain. Drums require a lot of space, and — as anyone who’s ever lived with a drummer knows — they can be quite noisy! Nowadays, I've been giving more attention to the guitar. It’s more practical, versatile, and still allows me to stay connected to the emotional side of music that has always been so important to me.

Finding time for these creative pursuits isn't always easy, but they continue to be a meaningful part of who I am.
