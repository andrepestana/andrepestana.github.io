## Professional

My name is Andre Pestana and I'm a software developer based in Canada with more than 15 years of experience working as a full-stack developer for the latest five years. The things I enjoy working most with are Javascript (Vue.js and Node.js), Linux/Unix-based OSes and
hybrid mobile development ([QuasarFramework](https://quasar.dev/)). I also have front-end and back-end with languages and tools, including: TypeScript, Java, Python, RESTful APIs, Databases, and Agile Development.

## Spoken Languages

My first language is Brazilian Portuguese and I have been studying English for a long time. Lately, I've been improving my Spanish (which I can understand well because of the similarities with Portuguese) and practicing French on Duolingo.

## Hobbies

I wish I had more time for hobbies. I used to play the drums, but it's an instrument that is hard to keep and maintain. It requires space and everybody knows how noisy it is. Lately, I've been giving more attention to the Guitars. I'm practicing some easy songs through Youtube and having a lot of fun with my daughter.
