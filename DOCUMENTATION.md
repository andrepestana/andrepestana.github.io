## How to Use the New Features

### Giscus Comments

Comments are automatically added to all content pages. To disable comments on a specific page, add the following to the page's frontmatter:

```yaml
---
comments: false
---
```

The Giscus comments system is configured to:
- Use the GitHub repository: andrepestana/andrepestana.github.io
- Map comments to pages based on pathname
- Support reactions
- Automatically adapt to light/dark theme

### Enhanced Homepage

The homepage now features a more flexible layout with categorized sections. You can modify these sections in the `index.md` file:

```yaml
customFeatures:
  - icon: ðŸ’»
    title: Section Title
    details: Section description text.
    items:
      - icon: ðŸ”§
        text: Link Text
        link: /path/to/page.html
      - icon: ðŸ”Œ
        text: Another Link
        link: /another/path.html
```

Each section can have:
- An icon (emoji or custom SVG)
- A title
- A description
- Multiple links with their own icons

## Project Structure

The updated project structure follows the latest VitePress conventions:

- `.vitepress/config.mjs` - Main configuration file
- `.vitepress/theme/index.mjs` - Theme customization
- `.vitepress/theme/components/` - Custom components
  - `MyLayout.vue` - Custom layout with Giscus integration
  - `Comments.vue` - Giscus comments component

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Notes on Implementation

1. The project now uses ES modules (`.mjs` files) for better compatibility with the latest VitePress version.
2. The Giscus configuration is set up with default repository information. You may want to customize the repository ID and category ID in the Comments.vue component.
3. The homepage features component provides a flexible way to organize and showcase different sections of your website.
4. Custom CSS has been added to enhance the appearance of the homepage features.

## Future Considerations

1. You may want to periodically update VitePress to benefit from new features and security updates.
2. Consider adding more interactive elements to the homepage as your content grows.
3. The Giscus comments system can be further customized with different themes or language settings.
