**App name:** Rule of Three  
**Developer:** Andre Pestana

## 1. Introduction

Rule of Three is an educational app that helps users learn and calculate proportions using the Rule of Three method.  
We care about your privacy. This policy explains what data the app collects, how it is used, and your rights.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

Rule of Three is designed to operate **without collecting any personal data** from users.

### 2.1 Data NOT collected

The app does **NOT** collect:

- Personal information (name, email, phone number, address, etc.)
- Financial information
- Contacts
- Photos or media from your device
- Location data
- App usage analytics
- Device identifiers
- Advertising IDs

### 2.2 Optional Share Feature

If you choose to use the **share card** feature, the app generates a temporary **image** based on the calculation result.

- This image remains **only on your device**.
- It is only shared if _you_ choose to send it through another app (WhatsApp, Facebook, Messages, Email, etc.).
- We do **not** access, collect, store, or transmit these images.

---

## 3. How We Use Your Information

Because the app does not collect any personal or device data, **no information is used, stored, or shared by the app.**

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

Rule of Three does **not** integrate with or send data to:

- Analytics platforms
- Advertising networks
- Tracking services
- External servers

All functionality happens **locally** on your device.

## 5. Children's Privacy

Rule of Three is safe for all ages.  
Since we do **not collect any information**, the app is compliant with COPPA for children under 13.

---

## 6. Data Security

Because no data is collected or stored, there is no risk of personal data exposure.  
All calculations and generated images occur locally on the user’s device.

---

## 7. Your Control and Choices

You remain in full control of:

- Whether to use the optional share feature
- Where any generated image is shared

The app does not store or retain any data.
