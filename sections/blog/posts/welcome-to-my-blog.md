Hello and welcome! I hope this is the first post of thousands more.

For a long time I've been looking for a blog solution like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) or [Vitepress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) which could give me some freedom to do the things my own way, would be low cost and simple. I used Jekyll before and it was cool but it is written in Ruby and I'm not interested in learning to code in Ruby now. Now I'm using Vitepress and I'm pretty satisfied with it. Some of the features I like from it are:

- Simple.
  - You just need to write [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) instead of HTML or edit pages with an editor
  - There's no need to setup a DB and maintain it
- Zero cost.
  - Vitepress is opensource
  - Github can host it for free
- Written in JS with Vue.js
  - This the part I really like because I can easily extend and customize it my way

## Looking for the perfect tool

Vuepress and Vitepress were developed to create Documentation. So many examples on the internet seems to mention _docs_ folder as the main folder but it seems to be changing in the latest versions of Vitepress. I see many people adopting Vitepress as a tool for blogging and other types of websites. At the moment I'm writing it is still in alpha version 1.0.0-alpha.21 and it's pretty good and usable. Of course there is some documentation to improve, the customization is not _that_ easy yet but I'm already very excited about it!
