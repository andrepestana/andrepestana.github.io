Hello and welcome! I hope this is the first post of thousands more.

For a long time, I've been looking for a blog solution like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), or [Vitepress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) which could give me some freedom to do the things my way, would be low cost and simple. I've used Jekyll before and it was cool, but it is a Ruby app and I'm not interested in learning to code in Ruby now. Now I'm using Vitepress and I'm pretty satisfied with it. Some of the features I like about it are:

- Simple.
  - You just need to write [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) instead of HTML or edit pages with an editor
  - There's no need to setup a DB and maintain it
- Zero cost.
  - Vitepress is opensource
  - Github can host it for free
- Written in JS with Vue.js
  - This the part I really like because I can easily extend and customize it my way

## Looking for the perfect tool

Vuepress and Vitepress were developed to create Documentation. So many examples on the internet seems to mention _docs_ folder as the main folder but it seems to be changing in the latest versions of Vitepress. I see many people adopting Vitepress as a tool for blogging and other types of websites. At the moment I'm writing it is still in alpha version 1.0.0-alpha.21 and it's pretty good and usable. Of course there is some documentation to improve, the customization is not _that_ easy yet but I'm already very excited about it!
