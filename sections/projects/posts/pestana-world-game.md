<!-- excerpt -->

Imagine that it is raining beer and at the same time a new virus starts to spread around the town where you live. That is your mission in this game: drink as much beer as you can and run away from this terrible virus that can kill you.

This is a work of fiction. Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events, is purely coincidental. ;)

## Description

Itâ€™s just a simple arcade game I started developing to learn [Phaser3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) and have some fun. [Phaser3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) is a javascript framework and it makes development really fun.

## Usage

On desktop, please use the left/right arrows to move the character to the sides and up arrow to jump. On mobile, please use the virtual joystick buttons added to the game as shown below:
