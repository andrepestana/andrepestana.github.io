<!-- excerpt -->

This website is coded using [Vitepress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) that is a Static Site Generator. In order words: it doesn't use a Database to keep data and all pages are static but it used some tools that help editors to maintain and make it less static. The pages are written using Markdown and an elegant website structure is generated. Also with some code you can extend it and create other features to satisfy your needs.

<!-- excerpt -->

> Fully static yet still dynamic
> Go wild with true SSG + SPA architecture. Static on page load, but engage users with 100% interactivity from there.
